# Network-analysis_Policy-effect-on-scientific-collaboration

We have a network consisting of individual agents, specifically scientists. The cluster
has been observed during two subsequent periods of time - before and after a policy
intervention. In the first period, no individuals were treated, while in the second
period, all individuals were treated. The data for this analysis consists of two datasets
that can be linked through individual identifiers. The first dataset, provides time-
invariant information on individual agents, including their identifier, coordinator
status, core member status, and gender. The second dataset, provides time-varying
information on dyads, including the source and target node identifiers, and the nature
of their scientific collaboration before and after treatment. All bilateral scientific
collaborations are undirected, with each dyad appearing twice, once in each direction.
Our objective in this analysis is to explore the impact of the policy intervention on the
scientific collaboration of the network cluster, using a social network analysis
approach. In this analysis we will try to answer the following questions:
- How many nodes and edges are in the network before and after the policy? This
could give you a sense of whether the policy had an effect on the number of
individuals or interactions in the network.
- What is the proportion of edges to possible edges in the network before and after
the policy? This could give you a sense of how connected the network is overall
and whether the policy affected the strength of connections between nodes.
- What is the clustering coefficient of the network before and after the policy? This
could give you a sense of the extent to which nodes in the network tend to form
clusters or groups, and whether the policy affected this tendency.
- What is the distribution of the number of connections (degree) among nodes in
the network before and after the policy? This could give you a sense of whether
the policy affected the way individuals are connected within the network.
- What is the centrality (betweenness, eigenvector, closeness) of nodes in the
network before and after the policy? This could give you a sense of which nodes
are most important within the network and whether the policy affected their
centrality.
